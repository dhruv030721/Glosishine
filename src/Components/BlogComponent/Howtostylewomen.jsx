            Exploring Contemporary Trends
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-5 font-signika text-md">
            In addition to classic styles, contemporary trends offer an
            opportunity to infuse your wardrobe with a fresh dose of style. This
            season, oversized shirts, asymmetrical silhouettes, and statement
            sleeves are all the rage. Experiment with bold prints, vibrant
            colours, and unexpected details to make a fashion-forward statement.
            A voluminous shirt with exaggerated sleeves can instantly elevate a
            simple pair of jeans, while an asymmetrical hem adds a modern twist
            to traditional shirting.
