          <div className='mt-5 ml-5'>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>• Measure your chest circumference around the fullest part, under your armpits. Compare this to the size chart to determine your chest size.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>• Pay close attention to the shoulder width - the seams should align with your natural shoulder line for a proper fit.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>• The sleeves should fall just at your wrist or slightly above, allowing you to showcase wrist accessories. Make sure you can raise your arms without the sleeves lifting past your wrists</p>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>•Consider your body type - if you have a more athletic build, you may prefer a jacket that accentuates your physique. For a looser fit, size up if you have a broader build.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>• Zip up the jacket to get a full sense of the overall fit. The zipper should close smoothly without excessive tightness and the jacket should maintain its shape when zipped.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>• If your measurements fall between sizes, it's better to size up if you need additional room.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>• If you plan to layer a sweater or sweatshirt under the jacket, add 2 inches to your chest measurement when referring to the size chart.</p>
            <p className='mt-5 font-serif'>• The jacket length should not go below your belt line it should hit at your waist or slightly below for the most flattering look.</p>
